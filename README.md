# Leading Indicators
First github project!
In this repo:

-  A few R scripts used for data cleaning, moving this about, and plotting
-  Webscraping python classes for a few sources like FRED and AlphaVantage (some with established APIs, some not) to combine into a dataset
-  A pipeline of feature selection and forecasting techniques to select leading indicators from the dataset and leverage them to predict sales
-  A Shiny server and UI to show off the project and make it useful

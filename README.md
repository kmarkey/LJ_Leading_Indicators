# LJ_Leading_Indicators
First project. Finding leading profit indicators from a local business.

ABOUT ME:
I am a third-year student at Case Western Reserve Univeristy studing Cognitive 
Science. However, I also have interests in the computational applications 
(particularly data science) within both cognitive science and biology. 
I've started this repo to capture some of the projects I have done in my first 
dsci class. I'm a fairly new programmer and mostly use R, but I want to get some
experience with python, APIs, genetic sequencing methods and imaging.

# Leading Indicators
In this repo:

-  Scripts used for scraping, cleaning, and aggregating data
-  Webscraping python classes for a few sources like FRED and AlphaVantage (mostly with established APIs, some not) to combine into a dataset
-  A pipeline of feature selection and prediction models to select leading indicators from the dataset and model predicted sales
-  A Shiny app

-  Still has some older notebooks, scripts, and visualizations
